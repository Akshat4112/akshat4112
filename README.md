Here are some ideas to get you started:
Hi, I'm Akshat, thanks for taking time out and checking my profile. I'm a Machine Learning Engineer, with an insatiable intellectual curiosity, and the ability to mine hidden gems located within a large set of data through data analysis, followed by feature engineering and then training model and putting it in production followed by deployment on AWS or GCP.

As a machine-learning engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between machine and intelligence, combining my technical knowledge over real-life problems to create an intelligent product. My goal is to always build products that are intelligent and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, analytical, and result-oriented user experiences.

When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably thinking over an idea, around the chessboard, or spending time on knowledge acquisition via book or MOOC.
